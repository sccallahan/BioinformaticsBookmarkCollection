# BioinformaticsBookmarkCollection
A giant, questionably organized HTML dump of bookmarked sites, blogs, posts, etc. I've found useful. Includes both embarassingly dumb and (hopefully) semi-intelligent Google searches. All at least loosely related to bioinformatics.

"Carson, why an HTML file of all things?" I hear you ask.

"Because I have bad foresight and bookmarked all of this instead of cataloguing it into a proper repo many moons ago," I answer.

...And also Firefox only exports to HTML, so here we are. Hopefully someone finds it useful!
